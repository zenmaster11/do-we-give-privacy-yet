            <p>The following companies are infringing on your's and million of other's privacy (and all over all pretty horrible): </p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                <li><strong>Facebook / Meta</strong>: 
                    <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                        <li>
                            Has been exposed many times for being a data mine, especially with their subsidiaries. You can even review their own <a href="https://www.facebook.com/policy.php">privacy notice</a> to see how much data they collect on you, however we all know it's much bigger than that.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            WhatsApp has been exposed to be transferring user's messages to the FBI, which they describe to "see in real-time"
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            WhatsApp has hundreds of contract employees, who review flagged messages, however it is unknown how due to WhatsApp being marketed as having end-to-end encryption.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Known to sell users' personal data to third parties

                        <li>
                            Holds the literal record for the biggest GDPR fine a company has faced, which was <strong>746 million euro ($888 million) </strong>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Hold many ethical issues in their data collection and employee treatment
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Spies on their own employees
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Collects a shit ton of data (ie. your name; address; phone number; location information; email of friends and others; voice recordings of Alexa; credit history information; wifi credentials; corporate and financial information), however they describe it as the information you hand over to them. <a href="Screenshot_28.png">The automatic data collection however is pretty generic for any FAANG company, but nonetheless is pretty interesting</a>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Collects a lot of your personal information (ie. location, name, browsing history, audio data, etc.) and claims to "personalize your experience", while it's just to make a quick buck (<a href="Screenshot_29.png">a bit from their privacy policy</a>)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Scans your emails (if you use Gmail of course) to "personalize" ads

                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>I've of course not mentioned everything they collect, because if I would I'd be sitting here writing this for literal days. You're free to <a href="https://github.com/zenmaster11/do-we-give-privacy-yet/pulls">open a P(ull)R(equest)</a> or <a href="https://github.com/zenmaster11/do-we-give-privacy-yet/issues/new">open an issue</a> if you'd wish to add or correct something.</p>
